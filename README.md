# 2. General Introduction

2.1 This repository aims at providing the codes and data regarding the paper entitled “……” for the public, and it is developed by University of XXX in UK,  The University of XXX in Hong Kong SAR, and XXX University in China.

2.2 We greatly appreciate the selfless spirits of these voluntary contributors of a series of open python libraries, including ifcopenshell (https://github.com/stefkeB/ifcopenshell_examples), pyautocad (https://github.com/reclosedev/pyautocad), and so on. Our work stands on the shoulders of these giants.

# 3 Repository reuse 
## 3.1 Set environment 
All environmental configurations are specified in the requirement.


Before submitting these codes to Github, all of them have been tested to be well-performed. Even so, we are not able to guarantee their operation in other computing environments due to the differences in the python version, computer operating system, and adopted hardware.
